# Blockchain Roadmap
This is little contribution to world so others can easily learn blockchain.

Blockchain is future of development, it provides downtime free, censorship free, fraud free system so you can easily build any application where trust is one of the big issue.

**Pros**  
- Revolutionary technology
- Distributed system

  - Cryptography
  - Security
  - Economics
  - Finance
  - Game Theory
- High Demand
- Remote Opportunities
- High Salary
- High Performance
- Low Cost
- Low Risk
- Low Maintenance

**Cons**
- High Responsibility
- Industry Trend
- Learning Curve
- No Space for Juniors
