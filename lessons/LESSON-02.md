## Working
A blockchain is a decentralized & distributed architecture. All records that are linked together in form of BLOCK using cryptography contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.

- Every transaction is recorded as soon as it occurs in a “block” of data
- Each block is connected to the ones before and after it
- Transactions are blocked together in an irreversible chain: a blockchain
