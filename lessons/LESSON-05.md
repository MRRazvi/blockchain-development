In Lecture 04, following are the some ways discussed for both **developers** and **non-developers** that how they can make money from Blockchain.
First let's discuss non-developer.

# Non-Developer (Investor):
###  - Holding:
HODL is a term derived from a misspelling of "hold," in the context of buying and holding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It's also commonly come to stand for "hold on for dear life" among crypto investors.Due to their highly volatile nature, cryptocurrencies provide great opportunities for traders to build up long and short positions frequently. However, “hodling” can provide more safety to investors, as investors are not exposed to short-term volatility and can avoid the risk of buying high but selling low.

###  - Staking:
If you're a crypto investor, staking is a concept you'll hear about often. Staking is the way many cryptocurrencies verify their transactions, and it allows participants to earn rewards on their holdings. But what is crypto staking? Staking cryptocurrencies is a process that involves committing your crypto assets to support a blockchain network and confirm transactions.

###  - Day Trading
Day Trading is also an option for Non-developer to earn via blockchain. Intraday trading, also called day trading, is one of the trading strategies used in both the stock and crypto market. It means buying and selling stocks/cryptocurrency on the same day. The purpose behind intraday trading is to reap benefits by price movements during the same trading day, i.e. before the market closes. However, the investor does not get ownership of the stocks in intraday trading. A person can do intraday trading through online trading platforms.

###  - Liquidity Farming
(Yield farming is also called liquidity farming.) Funds are locked, or staked, into smart contracts that control the liquidity pools DeFi lending protocols rely on. These are simply pooled funds from which borrowers draw funds. Pool members earn a share of the interest received based on how much they have locked. Yield farming is a means of earning interest on your cryptocurrency, similar to how you'd earn interest on any money in your savings account. And similarly to depositing money in a bank, yield farming involves locking up your cryptocurrency, called "staking," for a period of time in exchange for interest or other rewards, such as more cryptocurrency.

###  - Bitcoin Mining 
Bitcoin mining is the process by which new bitcoins are entered into circulation. It is also the way the network confirms new transactions and is a critical component of the blockchain ledger's maintenance and development. "Mining" is performed using sophisticated hardware that solves an extremely complex computational math problem. The first computer to find the solution to the problem receives the next block of bitcoins and the process begins again.

# **Devloper**
The demand for Blockchain Developers is higher than at any time before. As more and more industries are becoming reliant on the software, the demand for developers is increasing. I think the world actually needs more engineers. People that observe, think, design, and create effective and practical solutions to problems.
Following are the ways by which you can earn from blockchain as a Developer:


###  - Create Bot:
 The way the bot works is quite simple. Investors look for cryptocurrency trading bots that will be most beneficial to them and then download the code from the developer. Many bots charge user fees, some of which can be quite high. Each bot has different hardware and software requirements. To maximize the impact of a bot, an investor needs to know how to best use this tool.

### - Freelancing
